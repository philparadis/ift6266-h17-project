# ift6266-h17-project

Experiments, code, models and notes for the final project of the IFT6266-H2017 "Deep Learning" course by Aaron Courville.

# Requirements:

* theano (bleeding edge GPU version)
* keras

If you have jupyter, you can run the exp2_mlp.ipynb file from there.

Otherwise, simply activate your keras environment and run python ./exp2_mlp_fromnotebook.py for best results.

If you run exp1_mlp.py, it will run, but produce poor results.

# Steps to follow

1. Open a screen or tmux session (or don't you madman!)
2. Get a GPU allocation somehow (your grandma's video card, your lab's card, your own or the HELIOS cluster)
3. Activate your virtualenv or conda environment: source activate keras
4. python ./exp2_mlp_fromnotebook.py
