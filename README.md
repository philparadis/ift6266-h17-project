# ift6266-h17-project

Experiments, code, models and notes for the final project of the IFT6266-H2017 "Deep Learning" course by Aaron Courville.

# Requirements:

* theano (bleeding edge GPU version)
* keras

If you have jupyter, you can run the exp2_mlp.ipynb file from there.

Otherwise, simply activate your keras environment and run python ./exp2_mlp_fromnotebook.py for best results.

If you run exp1_mlp.py, it will run, but produce poor results.
